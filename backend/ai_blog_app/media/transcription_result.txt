 I'm here in San Francisco and I'm about to do something I've never done before. Well actually I do it all the time in my Tesla, but this time it's actually driving itself and nobody's in the driver's seat. But here's the catch. I have a flight to catch in. Oh two hours. So I want to see if the robot taxi can take me to all these places so I can bring back a souvenir for my fur babies back at home. First up, Union Square. A ride can arrive in 23 minutes. Book right $11.27. Holy okay. Let's see how long the waymo's going to take. Pick up time is three minutes. It's going to cost $14.55 and then just for the heck of it, let's try Uber. Holy wow. Uber's are expensive. $24.92 and it's four minutes away compared to the test of robot taxi which is going to take uh-oh. It's set 23 minutes. Now it says high service demand. Please come back later. So far it's not looking good for the test of robot taxi and I'm starting to get a little worried. It's still in testing, barely available and not open to the public just yet. So I don't even know if we could do this video. But surprisingly it's way cheaper than Uber or even Waymo. I tried it again but the ride canceled on me again but I was determined. On the third try I decided to change the destination to a closer spot. First up, Fisherman's War. After waiting almost an hour I've finally secured a robot taxi. Can't wait to see nobody in the driver's seat. Oh my god. Is that it? Is that just a minute of blue Tesla? There's someone in the driver's seat. I wasn't even saying robot taxi. Am I being scammed right now? Well I thought they were supposed to be like robot taxi signs. So it's pulsing red. It says do a motor. But I think this is it. 3111 C4. Please enter. Look for pulsing lights. So I can honk the horn. You can flash the lights. You can open the trunk. What? So cool. Welcome Christopher. You will be canceled after four minutes of inactivity. Okay so I'm gonna hurry up and there's a guy. I think it might be because we're in California. There's someone in the driver's seat. I don't know if he's allowed to interact with us or say his name or who he is. I'm just gonna pretend that he doesn't know him here and he's not listening to everything I say and I'm going to call him Bob. Hello Bob. And we're going. Oh my god it's doing it. So it actually is driving itself right now. Just like my Tesla which is insane. But it's a little different. You see how it's just first off it's gold that looks like. That glow is pretty cool. And then there's a robot taxi that says pullover, stop in lane, support. It's on chill mode. It seems to be doing really good so far. The robot taxi did really well starting off. It changed lanes made unprotected left turns and yielded for pedestrians without any issues. But then it did something that really surprised me. So 11 minutes to our destination. So we already lost some time because it canceled the trip on us twice. For some reason I guess I just didn't want to go to Union Square. We have to turn left and point five miles though. Oh here we go. Here we go. Changing lanes. Found opportunity. I wonder if it could reach signs. This says 7 to 10 3 to 7 Monday to Friday. No left turn. It's not 3 yet, is it? It's 3. No left turn. It's 3. Yeah he left. Bob left. So it tried to do a left turn but the sign says 3 to 7 PM Monday to Friday. It's a weekday. I was going to do it. I don't know if Bob did something because now it didn't do it. Oh did it? Whoa. It read the sign. It says Bob. Holy. Because with our RFSD it doesn't read the signs. That's the one problem. I was like how come it can't read the signs? I wonder if Waymo would have known too. I'm so curious. Ooh Waymo. We got some construction coming up here to move to the left. It signals. Oh the road is so bad. And it goes right to the correct lane without any hesitation. It's kind of nice. It's kind of stress-free. This is what we're going to be clean to see. Oh yeah. Oh that's it. That's the way we're going to get to. I could just relax. No need to drive. In San Francisco it's going to be stressed out. But just when I thought the robot taxi was perfect we encountered something unexpected. Oh the road's closed. The navigation wanted to go straight but the robot taxi realized the road was closed and turned instead. So it's taking a detour. This is the FSD experience baby. Manoeuvre in big buses. Now it's going to turn left if you know the detour says to go right. Look at that. There's a sign that says detour on the right side. So I'm assuming we should be going right but it wants us to go left. Looks like it's going to try it again. Uh oh. Is it going to do an infinite loop? And then now it's going to try to do this loop-de-loop thing. But I thought the road was closed. So we'll see what happens. It was about to turn left to circle back to the road we were on initially but then it thought the road was closed. So now it's trying to figure out what to do. The thing is it keeps trying to go straight. The robot taxi made a loop then just ended up in the same position. Oh it's the same thing as before. I wonder if it's going to think since it did it twice already. If it's going to think and know okay I can't do this yet. This is going to be very interesting. Road is closed but it still wanted to go straight. I wonder if Bob's going to have to take over. Oh. I think it's here already. No! Wow! Wow Tesla AI for watching. It just was going to do an infinite loop. We're about to do an inception type of situation when we just keep going in a loop but that is very interesting. Now we're back on FSD. I was pretty quick. I think it's just disengaged to go right and that was it. I hope it takes us to the correct place. Now it's going to turn left here. Got a lot of cars there. Unprotected left and there's a pedestrian with the doggy. Does this see the dog? Oh it does. I saw something. I saw a little dog yesterday. Look at that beautiful excuse perfectly. It's like Bob's driving us the whole time. The robot taxi saw everything. People even pets. I never once felt like it was unsafe. But then it did something a normal human would not have done. So there's a lot of obstacles here right now. Caution. There's a pedestrian. Uh oh. With a little girl. Oh sorry. Did it. Look at what it's doing. See all these cones. Know what to do. We're like not even in a road right now. Oh my god. It's so bumpy. Here's 39. Oh wow. It's actually just going to pull over. Route contains closed roads. I guess Bob has to wait here now. Thank you so much Bob. I appreciate it. I don't know if you're that's your name. Hopefully we're going to be doing more rides. So maybe I'll see you again. This is fun. Caught $10 and 22 stents for that ride, which is not bad at all. Let's get some food. That way. Let's get to the Picasso. Package secured. Oh look. So because the robot taxi couldn't take us to the Union Square, this will do. Let's see if we can go to one more spot and see if the robot taxi is going to take us there. All right. High service demand. One place I was really curious about is the famous Lombard Street. Because it'll be cool to see it kind of go through. But for some reason, the Tesla robot taxi would not route through Lombard Street. Oh no, it's not going to take us even if I put the location in the middle. So unfortunately I couldn't even do that today. It doesn't want to take me there. And we're running low on time. Next stop, Curidelia Square. So we only have to go like five minutes away. But it says a ride is going to arrive in 30 minutes. Only 279. So we're going to try to weigh more and see. They're going to arrive in one minute. Wow. But the crazy thing is to go the same distance. It's an extra $10. $12.83 versus $2.00 in the Tesla robot taxi. So is it worth waiting 30 minutes for? I don't know if I want to do that. I'm going to go walk faster. I'm just kidding. Okay, you're right. It's booked about three minutes away. It's like Apple air tag. 600 feet ahead. I don't understand which way it is. It's like 600 feet ahead. Am I supposed to cross that side? It says it's almost here. Oh, where? Uh oh. We're not going to make it. This is going to leave in one minute. I think we'll cook chat and leave in 42 seconds. I'm going the wrong way again. No, I'm not Jay walking. If $5 fee will be charged if you miss your ride. We're here. It's me. No. Oh, God. I got charged $5. It's my fault. I think I thought it was there because I got dropped off there with the robot taxi. This is we were all the way over there and then made the pickup all the way over there. Not even close to where I thought we were going to go. I miss Bob. Bob was such a good guy. Now it costs more for some reason. $14. Seriously, at this point I should just walk. No, I didn't say Siri. No, cancel Siri. So now we call it again and it should be here in two minutes. Aha. There's two of them now. Wait. They're yielding for each other. Far 4100 B83. Oh my God. There's a car bomb. This is so scary. Is this for me? E-C. Unlock. Oh. Hello. Start. It's crazy because there's someone in the back. Right away the Waymo runs into obstacles. Pedestrian. Oh. Damn. And then a bus sticks out in the lane. It's signaling to the left to go around. But that's not all. Pedestrian decides to walk in the middle of the street. Don't hit that lady. Ah. Someone's crossing on the green. This guy just de-gaps. My sis is what I hate about S7. Everyone's just honking at each other. Got the parking enforcement over there, giving tickets. If the whole world is full of robotaxies, there would be no stress everywhere. This guy's just trying to pull up a U-turn in the middle of the road. Not the robotaxie. The driver. The Waymo waited. Pulled over. But the crazy thing is that there's a ton of robotaxies in SF, not just Waymo, but Zooksham Amazon. Seeing so many weird self-driving vehicles in SF, unmarked cars, looking at this Mercedes-S-class with a laser on top as well. But most of the world still isn't used to seeing a car without a driver. Hello. They're like, what the heck? They're like the real ladies taking a photo. I think there's another Waymo behind us. Look. And it even shows it's a Waymo. What's up, bro? Oh yeah, this is it. But what? Did literally just drop this out of the middle of the street? What the? Go. Sorry. Wow. Is it just going to stay in the middle of the street right there? And it's gone. Get rid of Deli Square. We made it. Cost a ton of money. But it wasn't too bad. I do miss Bob, though. So hopefully we can call Bob for a final trip back. I did not expect to get this much. That's called our final robotaxie back to the Golden Gate Bridge. Let's see if it's worked. Oh my gosh, they're going to work. It says it's connecting. It actually says it's connecting right now. Check your network connection. What do you mean? All right, I can arrive in eight minutes. Book right. 799. Come on, come on, come on, come on, Bob. Give me the give me Bob. Oh, no Bob. It's a white testimony. Why? It should be turning right any second now. Any second now. Oh, it's at a red light. Come on, come on, come on. And the where the robotaxie go. It says it's like right here. There it is. The hub caps are gone. Cool. It's really not just in said robotaxie. So I pulled over. Unfortunately, we did not get Bob again. But I'll call this new guy Larry. We're going to start to the app this time. And there it goes right there. Made the noise and everything. And it's off. Got the white interior white Tesla. I always thought the robotaxies were black. And it said robotaxie. None of these actions at robotaxie on them. I wonder if it's because of California law. But then I found out that unlike Austin, where Tesla is already running its robotaxie program. Here in San Francisco, they only have a permit for ride healing using robotaxie technology. And it's crazy because they could just find any Tesla if they really wanted to with the same hardware for camera system and just put on the FSD software. And boom, robotaxie. We would never know. See if we run into any issues. Seize the bump. Slows down. Cool. But my Tesla is not too. Something to the left. Because it sees that debris there. And also because we have to go left. A lot of people, a lot of variables. This is why it's kind of stressful driving here. Looks like it's trying to turn left. I'm not sure why. Probably because of the biker. Has a pretty simple route. I wish it kind of did with the way Mo did and showed what I see up there. Would show it down here too. What it knows the songs I like. Oh my Spotify's link. That's so cool. But then we hit the last exit before the Golden Gate Bridge. Just point zero one miles left and still robotaxie at the cost two lanes. Wow, it did it. I didn't think it would do it. But it was pretty aggressive. That's the only way to drive that part. You have to be aggressive get in there. And what way to finish it then nice ride in a Tesla robotaxie. With nobody driving except for my boy Larry over here. So how do I tip the person? No tips. Larry says no tip. I'm sorry. Thanks man. So we made it back to the Golden Gate Bridge. Did you know this is inside the Golden Gate Bridge thing? All these steel wires. That is cool. But mission accomplished. I still have a solid. Overall the robotaxie did great. However it wasn't without the flaws. The safety driver bob actually had to take over once because it was trying to do like an infinite loop when the road was closed. It was able to get me to my destination when it did come. However because it's still in beta there's not enough robotaxies around. Overall it was a super exciting experience and so stress free. I was able to visit all the awesome sites without having to worry about parking. People honking at me and I'm actually amazed and impressed at what Tesla has been able to do with the cameras they have compared to their competitors like Waymo, Zooks and all that stuff with all those lasers and stuff. The future is looking bright for full self-driving but I get toly see more Tesla robotaxies on the road. Even my car can be a robotaxie because that's everything it needs to be a robotaxie in the near future. That's my bus I gotta go ahead and hop on and get to the airport. What? I can't even tell I'm on full self-driving and not in my robotax because the same car.
