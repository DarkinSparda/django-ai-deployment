    "## Doom: A Glimpse into Interdimensional Chaos The Doom franchise, a cornerstone of gaming, boasts a rich lore spanning ancient civilizations and modern-day conflicts. This story combines the original 1993 narrative with the 2004 reboot, Doom 3, offering a concise look at its universe. ### Ancient Mars and the First Cataclysm Long before humanity, a sophisticated Martian civilization mastered interdimensional travel. Their experiments, however, inadvertently opened a portal to Hell, unleashing demonic forces that annihilated them. The survivors fled, some to Earth, while the rest created the Soul Cube, a mystical artifact used to banish the demons and seal the Hell Gate. They left behind a warning about their dangerous technology before their extinction. ### Humanity's Unwitting Repeat Centuries later, humanity evolved and, in the early 2000s, established the Union Aerospace Corporation (UAC) to terraform Mars. Excavating the planet, they discovered the ancient Martian ruins and their portal technology. Unable to decipher the warnings, the UAC reactivated the dimensional portals, once again opening a gateway to Hell. Demons swarmed, decimating the UAC personnel. ### The Marine's Stand A lone Marine was dispatched to Mars to investigate the distress calls. He uncovered the UAC's illicit activities and the demonic invasion. Wielding the recovered Soul Cube, he battled through Mars bases, traversed dimensional portals, and ultimately confronted the demons at Hell's Gate. Using the Soul Cube's power, he sealed the portal, returning to Earth as a hero. ### Doom 2: A Sequel's Threat While Doom 3 served as a reboot, Doom 2 acted as a direct sequel to the original. Upon returning to Earth, the Marine discovered a new Hell Gate had opened. After a demonic incursion at a human evacuation facility, he learned the demons had breached a portal in his hometown. The Marine eliminated the threat there and entered Hell himself, defeating the Icon of Sin and permanently sealing the gate. Earth began its recovery, and the threat of demonic invasion was seemingly over."

       "  AIMessage(content=\"## From Ancient Civilizations to Interdimensional Warfare: The Epic Saga of Doom\\n\\nLong before humanity gazed at the stars, a sophisticated Martian civilization thrived, exploring the mysteries of their world and the cosmos. Their scientific prowess led them to discover interdimensional travel, a technology that would ultimately pave the way for their downfall. In their pursuit of progress, they accidentally tore open a portal to Hell, unleashing a tide of demonic forces that decimated their civilization.\\n\\n### The Martian Legacy and the Birth of Humanity\\n\\nScattered by the infernal onslaught, some Martians fled to Earth, while the survivors forged a powerful artifact known as the Soul Cube. This mystical device was instrumental in repelling the demons and sealing the Hell Gate. Before their extinction, the Martians left behind a solemn warning, urging future civilizations to avoid tampering with their discoveries. Their genetic remnants, however, would become the foundation for the evolution of humankind.\\n\\nCenturies later, humanity rose, developing civilizations and eventually embarking on ambitious projects, including the terraforming of Mars. This endeavor led to the formation of the Union Aerospace Corporation (UAC), which unearthed the secrets of the ancient Martians. Unfortunately, without the ability to decipher the Martian language, the UAC scientists remained ignorant of the dire warnings, and their experiments with dimensional portals once again ripped open the gate to Hell.\\n\\n### The Marine's Stand Against the Infernal Horde\\n\\nThe Martian bases were once again overrun by demons, with UAC personnel meeting grim fates – killed, driven to madness, or corrupted. It was at this critical juncture that a lone, unnamed Marine was dispatched to Mars to investigate the escalating distress signals. Facing a terrifying reality of demonic infestation and the UAC's dubious activities, the Marine fought through the ravaged bases. His journey culminated in the discovery of the Soul Cube, a weapon of immense power.\\n\\nArmed with this ancient artifact, the Marine confronted the demonic forces, journeying through portals to reach the very gates of Hell. He wielded the Soul Cube to sever the connection between dimensions, successfully sealing Hell off from their reality and returning to Earth as a hero. This harrowing experience forms the core of *Doom 3*, a reboot that reimagined the original narrative.\\n\\n### The Echoes of Doom: A Direct Sequel and the Icon of Sin\\n\\nWhile *Doom 3* offered a fresh perspective, *Doom 2* served as a direct continuation of the original *Doom*'s story. Following the events on Mars, the Marine returned to Earth, only to discover that another Hell Gate had inexplicably opened. As governments attempted to evacuate humanity, the demon-infested facility designated for survivors fell. The Marine intervened, eradicating the demonic presence with brutal efficiency.\\n\\nHe then received crucial intelligence regarding the location of Hell's Gate, which, coincidentally, had manifested in his own hometown. Racing against time, the Marine purged the demonic infestation before stepping through the portal himself. Within Hell, he confronted the Icon of Sin, the fearsome guardian of the demonic realm. After a climactic battle, the Marine defeated the Icon of Sin, returned to Earth, and permanently sealed the Hell Gate. With Earth's survival secured, humanity began the arduous process of rebuilding.\\n\\nThis, in essence, is the epic saga of Doom, a narrative spanning millennia, from ancient Martian civilizations to humanity's desperate fight for survival against interdimensional horrors.\", additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={'prompt_feedback': {'block_reason': 0, 'safety_ratings': []}, 'finish_reason': 'STOP', 'model_name': 'gemini-2.5-flash-lite', 'safety_ratings': [], 'model_provider': 'google_genai'}, id='lc_run--e5ca829b-bb35-4226-96fc-be1d3890b1c7-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 1052, 'output_tokens': 687, 'total_tokens': 1739, 'input_token_details': {'cache_read': 0}})]}"

       "\"## From Ancient Civilizations to Interdimensional Warfare: The Epic Saga of Doom\\n\\nLong before humanity gazed at the stars, a sophisticated Martian civilization thrived, exploring the mysteries of their world and the cosmos. Their scientific prowess led them to discover interdimensional travel, a technology that would ultimately pave the way for their downfall. In their pursuit of progress, they accidentally tore open a portal to Hell, unleashing a tide of demonic forces that decimated their civilization.\\n\\n### The Martian Legacy and the Birth of Humanity\\n\\nScattered by the infernal onslaught, some Martians fled to Earth, while the survivors forged a powerful artifact known as the Soul Cube. This mystical device was instrumental in repelling the demons and sealing the Hell Gate. Before their extinction, the Martians left behind a solemn warning, urging future civilizations to avoid tampering with their discoveries. Their genetic remnants, however, would become the foundation for the evolution of humankind.\\n\\nCenturies later, humanity rose, developing civilizations and eventually embarking on ambitious projects, including the terraforming of Mars. This endeavor led to the formation of the Union Aerospace Corporation (UAC), which unearthed the secrets of the ancient Martians. Unfortunately, without the ability to decipher the Martian language, the UAC scientists remained ignorant of the dire warnings, and their experiments with dimensional portals once again ripped open the gate to Hell.\\n\\n### The Marine's Stand Against the Infernal Horde\\n\\nThe Martian bases were once again overrun by demons, with UAC personnel meeting grim fates – killed, driven to madness, or corrupted. It was at this critical juncture that a lone, unnamed Marine was dispatched to Mars to investigate the escalating distress signals. Facing a terrifying reality of demonic infestation and the UAC's dubious activities, the Marine fought through the ravaged bases. His journey culminated in the discovery of the Soul Cube, a weapon of immense power.\\n\\nArmed with this ancient artifact, the Marine confronted the demonic forces, journeying through portals to reach the very gates of Hell. He wielded the Soul Cube to sever the connection between dimensions, successfully sealing Hell off from their reality and returning to Earth as a hero. This harrowing experience forms the core of *Doom 3*, a reboot that reimagined the original narrative.\\n\\n### The Echoes of Doom: A Direct Sequel and the Icon of Sin\\n\\nWhile *Doom 3* offered a fresh perspective, *Doom 2* served as a direct continuation of the original *Doom*'s story. Following the events on Mars, the Marine returned to Earth, only to discover that another Hell Gate had inexplicably opened. As governments attempted to evacuate humanity, the demon-infested facility designated for survivors fell. The Marine intervened, eradicating the demonic presence with brutal efficiency.\\n\\nHe then received crucial intelligence regarding the location of Hell's Gate, which, coincidentally, had manifested in his own hometown. Racing against time, the Marine purged the demonic infestation before stepping through the portal himself. Within Hell, he confronted the Icon of Sin, the fearsome guardian of the demonic realm. After a climactic battle, the Marine defeated the Icon of Sin, returned to Earth, and permanently sealed the Hell Gate. With Earth's survival secured, humanity began the arduous process of rebuilding.\\n\\nThis, in essence, is the epic saga of Doom, a narrative spanning millennia, from ancient Martian civilizations to humanity's desperate fight for survival against interdimensional horrors.\""
